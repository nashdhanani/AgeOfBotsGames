            <h2>🎮 Game Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Habib Punja game is entirely fictional, has no historical context, and does not resemble or reference any person, living or deceased.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Habib Punja game requires thought yet is engaging and enjoyable. In terms of strategy and tactics required, 
                it will appeal to players of strategic games like Chess, Go, Diplomacy, and Civ6/7 who are looking for a fun way to 
                sharpen their critical thinking skills and competitive spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
                This online version is played against two AI players with distinct personalities and has implemented all the rules and 
                mechanics of the card game.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Structure -->
        <div class="rules-section" id="structure">
            <h2>🏗️ Game Structure</h2>
            <p>
                Habib Punja is a multiplayer and multiround strategic card game where the objective is to build matching cards of 
                <strong>Triples</strong> or <strong>Ladders</strong>, required for the Hand being played, by drawing cards, publishing them 
                as quickly as possible, extending those published sequences with remaining cards, and discarding cards.
            </p>
            <p>
                The winner of each hand is the player who discards their last remaining card before the opponents.
            </p>

            <h3>Duration</h3>
            <p>
                Each hand lasts 10-15 minutes, and playing all 7 rounds provides a couple of hours of competitive fun. 
                In the online version, you can play the full 7 rounds or click "New Game" to choose a quick combination 
                of specific hands to practice advanced tactics.
            </p>

            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <p>
                There are seven rounds. In each round, the winner is the player who goes out first by discarding their last card. 
                Other players accumulate penalty points equal to the total value of cards still in their hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                The winner of all seven rounds is <strong>Crowned</strong>. The player with the most penalty points is the 
                <strong>Pumpkin</strong> (think Jack O'Lantern), or as in the fable from MuBot, <strong>Habib Punja</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Gameplay Flow</h3>
            <p>The online game simulates a Bridge or Poker table setup:</p>
            <ul style="color: #cbd5e1; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Habot</strong> sits to your left (aggressive "Rabbit" style)</li>
                <li><strong>Jabot</strong> sits to your right (patient "Tortoise" style)</li>
                <li>Play proceeds clockwise</li>
                <li>First player determined by draw (highest card starts, like Bridge)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Each Turn</h3>
            <ol style="color: #cbd5e1; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Draw a card from either the discard pile (face-up) or the deck</li>
                <li>Use tools to sort your cards or arrange them manually</li>
                <li>Publish sequences if you meet the hand requirements (optional)</li>
                <li>Extend your own or opponents' published sequences (if you've published)</li>
                <li>Discard one card to end your turn</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Buy Window</h3>
            <p>
                When a player discards, the next player in turn has first chance at it. If they don't take it, 
                other players get a 5-second buy window to take the discarded card. Taking a card this way is called a 
                <strong>"Buy"</strong> and comes with a penalty: you must also draw an additional card from the deck.
            </p>

            <h3>Publishing</h3>
            <p>
                When you have the required sequences for the current hand, the Publish button enables. You can choose to publish 
                immediately or delay to accumulate extension cards. Once any player publishes, they gain the right to extend 
                sequences on subsequent turns.
            </p>

            <h3>Extending Sequences</h3>
            <p>
                After publishing, you can extend your own sequences or any opponent's published sequences. This is how players 
                rapidly reduce their hand size. You cannot extend sequences in the same turn you publish them.
            </p>

            <h3>Winning</h3>
            <p>
                The first player to discard their last card wins the hand and scores zero points. All other players add up 
                the value of their remaining cards as penalty points.

                <div class="term-title">Discard Pile</div>
                <p>The pile of face-up discarded cards. After drawing, a player must discard one card to end their turn. You can select from the discard pile and discard the same card again in the same turn.</p>
