## 🔧 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### **Step 1: Download All Files**

Download these files from Claude:
1. index.html
2. css/ folder (7 files)
3. js/game.js

### **Step 2: Copy to Your Repository**

```powershell
# Navigate to your repo
cd D:\AgeOfBotsGames\production

# You should have this structure:
# production/
# ├── index.html
# ├── css/
# │   └── (7 CSS files)
# └── js/
#     └── game.js
```

### **Step 3: Verify Files**

```powershell
# Check CSS files
dir css

# Check JS file
dir js

# You should see:
# - 7 CSS files in css/
# - 1 game.js in js/
```

### **Step 4: Test Locally**

Open `production/index.html` in your browser:
- ✅ Game should load
- ✅ All styling should work
- ✅ AI opponents should function
- ✅ Console should show v2.5.0 branding

### **Step 5: Deploy to Production**

```powershell
cd D:\AgeOfBotsGames

# Stage all changes
git add production/

# Commit
git commit -m "v2.5.0: Refactor to modular architecture (CSS split into 7 files)"

# Push to GitHub (auto-deploys to Cloudflare)
git push origin main

# Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
```

### **Step 6: Verify Live Site**

Visit: https://ageofbotsgames.com/production/

Check:
- ✅ Game loads correctly
- ✅ Styling looks identical to v2.5.0
- ✅ All features work
- ✅ No console errors

## 🚀 NEXT PHASE (Optional)

If you want to further modularize the JavaScript into smaller files:

**Proposed JS Structure:**
```
js/
├── config.js         (~150 lines) - Game rules, constants
├── deck.js           (~200 lines) - Deck & card management  
├── ai-logic.js       (~800 lines) - AI decision making
├── player-actions.js (~600 lines) - Draw, discard, buy
├── publishing.js     (~500 lines) - Sequence validation
├── ui-manager.js     (~600 lines) - DOM updates
└── main.js           (~200 lines) - Initialization
```

This can be done as Phase 2 when needed.
