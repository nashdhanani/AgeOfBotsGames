## What is Habib Punja?

Habib Punja is a strategic card game built around a single idea:

> **Good players win hands. Masters win games.**

Each match is a **7-hand war**. You can lose individual hands and still win the championship—if you manage risk, limit devastation, and out-think your opponents.

## The Four Minds at the Table

You’re not playing against “random bots.” You’re facing distinct personalities:

- **Habot (Rabbit)** — fast, aggressive, momentum-driven.
- **Jabot (Tortoise)** — patient, threshold-based, surgical.
- **MuBot (Zen Master Advisor)** — wisdom, risk control, long-game thinking (commentator/advisor, not a player).
- **Joko (Provocateur)** — playful chaos, pressure, and table energy (commentator/advisor, not a player).

## The Lotus Philosophy (High-Level)

Like the lotus flower that rises pure from muddy waters, we believe AI should emerge with grace, wisdom, and purpose.

Each bot we create carries a unique personality and strategic mind—designed to challenge, teach, and inspire through play.

> **“We don’t build algorithms. We cultivate minds.”**

(Full studio-level Lotus content will live under AgeOfBotsStudios in the future; this wiki keeps the focus on the game.)
