# Characters: The Four Minds

Habib Punja is designed to feel like a strategy night with friends—except some of those “friends” are AI minds with distinct, repeatable personalities.

> **Habot and Jabot are AI players.**  
> **MuBot and Joko are commentators/advisors (not players).**

---

## Habot (Rabbit) — The Aggressive Tactician
**Role:** AI opponent (player)  
**Personality:** fast, bold, impulse-forward  
**Style:** early publishing, momentum, controlled chaos  
**Strengths:**
- wins tempo
- forces others to react
- punishes hesitation
**Weaknesses:**
- higher risk of nukes
- can overbuy or publish prematurely

**Player counter:** play the war, not the hand; bait Habot into overcommitting.

## Jabot (Tortoise) — The Patient Strategist
**Role:** AI opponent (player)  
**Personality:** calm, deliberate, threshold-based  
**Style:** waits for structure, publishes when stable  
**Strengths:**
- disciplined buys
- minimizes waste
- strong late-hand execution
**Weaknesses:**
- may give tempo away
- can stall if forced into uncomfortable builds

**Player counter:** pressure Jabot with tempo and deny predictable ladder paths.

## MuBot — Zen Master Advisor
**Role:** commentator / mentor  
**Personality:** wise, philosophical, stabilizing  
**Mission:** keep players on an even playing field by delivering “pearls of wisdom” and strategic framing.

MuBot’s primary lens is the 7-hand war:
- avoid devastation,
- limit nukes,
- do not chase impulse,
- play the opponent as much as the cards.

## Joko — Provocateur and Hype Catalyst
**Role:** commentator / instigator  
**Personality:** mischievous, playful, dramatic  
**Mission:** create atmosphere and table tension—without distracting from gameplay.

In future versions, Joko’s visual effects may include comic-style “fireball” moments tied to high-risk events.
