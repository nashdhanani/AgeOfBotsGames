# Characters: The Four Minds

Habib Punja is designed to feel like a strategy night with friends—except some of those "friends" are AI minds with distinct, learnable personalities.

> **Habot and Jabot are AI players.**  
> **MuBot and Joko are commentators/advisors (not players).**

---

## Habot (Rabbit) 🐰 — The Aggressive Tactician

**Role:** AI opponent (player)  
**Personality:** Fast, bold, impulse-forward  
**Style:** Early publishing, momentum plays, controlled chaos  

### Strengths
- Wins tempo and forces reactions
- Punishes hesitation
- Strong early-game pressure
- Capitalizes on opponent mistakes

### Weaknesses
- Higher risk of nukes (devastating losses)
- Can overbuy or publish prematurely
- Sometimes sacrifices stability for speed
- Vulnerable to patient counter-play

### Player Counter-Strategy
> *"Play the war, not the hand."*  
> Bait Habot into overcommitting. Let the rabbit run too fast and stumble.

### Sample Banter
- *"Speed wins games!"*
- *"Too slow, too bad!"*
- *"Catch me if you can!"*

## Jabot (Tortoise) 🐢 — The Patient Strategist

**Role:** AI opponent (player)  
**Personality:** Calm, deliberate, threshold-based  
**Style:** Waits for structure, publishes when stable  

### Strengths
- Disciplined buying (rarely wastes buys)
- Minimizes waste and risk
- Strong late-hand execution
- Consistent across all 7 hands

### Weaknesses
- May give tempo away to aggressive players
- Can stall if forced into uncomfortable builds
- Sometimes too conservative with buys
- Vulnerable to sustained pressure

### Player Counter-Strategy
> *"Pressure the tortoise."*  
> Apply tempo pressure and deny predictable ladder paths. Force Jabot out of the comfort zone.

### Sample Banter
- *"Patience reveals the path."*
- *"Steady progress wins wars."*
- *"No rush. The cards will come."*

## MuBot 🧘 — Zen Master Advisor

**Role:** Commentator / Mentor (non-player)  
**Personality:** Wise, philosophical, stabilizing  
**Position:** LEFT side of board (above Deck)

### Mission
Keep players on an even playing field by delivering "pearls of wisdom" and strategic framing.

### MuBot's Lens: The 7-Hand War
- Avoid devastation
- Limit nukes
- Do not chase impulse
- Play the opponent as much as the cards

### Sample Wisdom
- *"Consider the war, not just this battle."*
- *"A buy spent rashly is a buy wasted."*
- *"Watch their patterns. Learn their tells."*
- *"The master wins before the hand is dealt."*

### When MuBot Speaks
- Hand start (strategic overview)

## Joko 🎭 — Provocateur and Hype Catalyst

**Role:** Commentator / Instigator (non-player)  
**Personality:** Mischievous, playful, dramatic  
**Position:** RIGHT side of board (above Discard)

### Mission
Create atmosphere and table tension—without distracting from gameplay. Joko is the voice of excitement.

### Sample Hype
- *"OH! What a play!"*
- *"The tension is REAL!"*
- *"This is getting GOOD!"*
- *"Did NOT see that coming!"*

### When Joko Speaks
- Game start (building excitement)
- Big plays (buys, publications)
- Close hands (tension building)
- Championship finale (celebration)

### Future Enhancements
In future versions, Joko's visual effects may include comic-style "fireball" moments tied to high-risk events.
