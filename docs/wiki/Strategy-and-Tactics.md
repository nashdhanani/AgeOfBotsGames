# Strategy & Tactics (v5.1.0)

This guide covers **strategy (war-level thinking)**, **tactics (hand-level execution)**, and **tutorial guidance** for players learning the system.

## The Strategic Frame: Battle vs War

**Winning the match** is the objective. Hands are individual battles.

Key principles:
- One hand lost ≠ game lost
- Avoid nukes (devastating outcomes)
- Winning 4+ hands typically wins the championship
- Consistent small losses are better than one catastrophic hand

## Tactical Core

### 1) Buying Discipline
- Buys are a scarce resource.
- Buy only when it materially improves your build path.
- Track remaining buys and plan for later hands (Hand 7 is tighter).

### 2) Publishing Timing
Publishing early gives tempo and reduces uncertainty.
Publishing late gives stability but risks being outpaced.

A strong heuristic:
- Publish when your build is *stable* and your remaining hand is unlikely to collapse.

### 3) Ladder Construction
- Choose a ladder suit that you can realistically extend.
- Avoid spreading across too many suits.
- Watch opponent discards: discarded suits are signals.

### 4) Risk Management
Risk is not “bad.” Unmanaged risk is.
- Take calculated risks early when the series score allows it.
- Shift to defensive play when ahead.
- If behind, apply pressure without detonating your own position.

If you’re new:
- Start by learning Hand 1–2 mechanics (triples + a basic ladder).
