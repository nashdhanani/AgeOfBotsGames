# Strategy & Tactics (v5.1.2)

This guide covers **strategy (war-level thinking)**, **tactics (hand-level execution)**, and **practical guidance** for players learning the system.

## The Strategic Frame: Battle vs War

**Winning the championship** is the objective. Individual hands are battles within the war.

### Core Principles
- One hand lost ≠ game lost
- Avoid nukes (devastating outcomes)
- Winning **4+ hands** typically wins the championship
- Consistent small losses are better than one catastrophic hand
- Play your opponents, not just your cards

---

## Tactical Fundamentals

### 1) Buying Discipline

Buys are a **scarce strategic resource**, not a reflex action.

**When to Buy:**
✅ Card completes or nearly completes a sequence  
✅ Card is a key rank you've been tracking  
✅ Denying an opponent a critical card  
✅ Early in a hand when you have buys to spare

**When NOT to Buy:**
❌ Card only marginally improves your hand  
❌ You're low on buys and it's not Hand 7 yet  
❌ The penalty card risk outweighs the gain  
❌ You're already close to publishing

**Buy Window Awareness (v5.1.2):**
- Watch the button state: 🟢 GREEN = your opportunity
- You have **16 seconds** to decide
- 🟡 AMBER means an AI is deciding—watch and learn their patterns

### 2) Publishing Timing

Publishing locks your build and makes sequences visible to all.

**Early Publishing (Habot Style):**
- ✅ Wins tempo
- ✅ Reduces hand size
- ✅ Forces opponents to react
- ❌ Locks you into current build
- ❌ Opponents see your patterns

**Late Publishing (Jabot Style):**
- ✅ Maximum flexibility
- ✅ More stable builds
- ✅ Element of surprise
- ❌ Risk of being outpaced
- ❌ Larger hand = more deadwood risk

**Optimal Heuristic:**
> *Publish when your build is stable and your remaining hand is unlikely to collapse.*

### 3) Ladder Construction (Hands 2, 3, 5, 6, 7)

Ladders require more planning than triples:

**Key Principles:**
- Choose a ladder suit you can realistically extend
- Avoid spreading across too many suits
- Watch opponent discards—discarded suits are signals
- Middle ranks (6-7-8) are most flexible

**Warning Signs:**
- Too many gaps in your sequence
- Key cards already in discard pile
- Opponents holding cards you need

### 4) Risk Management

> *Risk is not "bad." Unmanaged risk is.*

**Risk Tolerance by Position:**
| Series Position | Risk Approach |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Ahead by 2+ hands | Conservative—protect the lead |
| Ahead by 1 hand | Balanced—calculated risks |
| Tied | Balanced—standard play |
| Behind by 1 hand | Aggressive—apply pressure |
| Behind by 2+ hands | High risk—force action |

## Opponent-Specific Strategies

### Countering Habot (Rabbit) 🐰

Habot plays fast and aggressive. Counter with patience:

1. **Let Habot overcommit** — Speed creates mistakes
2. **Don't panic-buy** — Habot wants you to react emotionally
3. **Track Habot's discards** — Reveals their build path
4. **Punish early publishing** — Extend Habot's sequences for yourself

### Countering Jabot (Tortoise) 🐢

Jabot plays slow and steady. Counter with pressure:

1. **Apply tempo** — Don't let Jabot get comfortable
2. **Deny ladder paths** — Hold cards Jabot likely needs
3. **Publish first** — Force Jabot to adjust plans
4. **Exploit conservatism** — Jabot may pass on good buys
