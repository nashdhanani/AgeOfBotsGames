# Roadmap (Public)

This roadmap focuses on near-term game evolution (Phase 1–3).

---

## Phase 1: Public Beta Foundation (Completed for v5.1.0)
- Stable web delivery
- Multi-device testing (iOS Safari/Chrome, Android Chrome)
- Strategy guide + resources + characters pages aligned
- Accessibility guidance

---

## Phase 2: Atmosphere Layer
- Banter system (MuBot + Joko as commentators)
- Habot/Jabot expressive bubbles
- Optional comic FX (kept tasteful)
- Victory animations (Rabbit/Tortoise victory lap)

---

## Phase 3: Guided Intelligence
- “Ask MuBot” hint layer for complex/stuck states
- Adaptive coaching, still fair to all players
- Optional challenge modes

(Studio-level initiatives will evolve over time; this wiki remains focused on the game.)
