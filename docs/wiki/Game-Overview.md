# Habib Punja: Strategic 7-Hand War (v5.1.0)

Play: https://AgeOfBotsGames.com

Habib Punja is a 3-player strategic card game presented as a **7-hand championship**.  
Your goal is not to “win every hand,” but to **win the war** by managing risk and avoiding devastating losses.

## Core Concepts

### The 7-Hand War
- One hand lost ≠ game lost
- Avoid catastrophic “nuke” hands
- Winning **4+ hands** typically secures the championship
- Consistent small losses are better than a single devastating loss
- Maintain a **“battle vs war”** mentality

### Builds and Requirements
Each hand has a different build requirement (triples and/or ladders). Requirements increase in complexity across the seven hands.

### Buying
Buying adds a card to your hand, but buys are limited. Buys are a strategic resource, not a reflex.

### Publishing
Publishing locks your build for the hand. Publishing early can win tempo; publishing too early can backfire if your build is fragile.

## Win Condition (Championship)

The championship is determined across all seven hands. Players should optimize for:

- maximizing hand wins,
- minimizing large negative outcomes,
- exploiting opponent tendencies (Habot vs Jabot),
- and making endgame decisions based on the current series score.
